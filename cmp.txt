COMPRESSION

	
This utility provides the facility of 
compressing text files. It accepts the 
text file name from the user and compresses 
it with a ratio about 15%. The compressed 
file will have the same name of the text 
file with the .CMP extension. The package
 simulates the compression process with 
the help of progress bar and gives the 
detailed report about the compression 
(i.e., Source file name, Destination 
file name, sizes, compression ratios etc.,)
