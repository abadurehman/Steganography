DE-EMBED




This process plays an alternate role against the embed.
 Here the package accepts the Image file name that 
present in the system. The process should checks for the presence of data, if the presence of data is identified, then the process
 request the path of the destination file (i.e., Data 
file with .CMP extension) for the retrieval of data 
from the Image file. Here all the process is 
graphically simulated with the help of progress bar.
