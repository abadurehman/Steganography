EMBED  &  DE-MBED


This module deals with identifying the data and the 
image to embed the data into the image 
before it can be transmitted. This is then followed 
by compression to increase the rate of 
transfer of files between the networks.

The module opens by prompting the user to identify 
the file that need to be transmitted
 across the network. The file is then selected using 
the GUI interface provided through
 JAVA. The module then prompts to identify the image
 file, which needs to house the data 
file. The developed system will provide support to
 select and embed data into .bmp & .jpg
 files. The selected image file is then previewed 
before it can house the data. The data is 
then embedded into the image file in such a way 
that the image file is not corrupted; at the 
same time the data is secure. The image if hacked 
or interrupted by a third party can be 
viewed in any browser without actually displaying 
the data. The data on the receivers end is
 isolated and removed from the image.
The module deals with identifying the hidden data 
in the image. The module receives the
 image file . The image file is then browsed to 
remove the associated data. The data is then
 removed from the image file.



This process plays the vital role in the steganography part.
 Here the package accepts the Image file name and Data file 
name from the user. 

The package embed the compressed Data file with the Image
 file specified by the user, in such a way that the image
 will not be distributed after the embed process.
 The embedding process is graphically simulated with 
the help of progress bar.
