INTRODUCTION


The system deals with security during transmission
 of data. Commonly used technologies are 
cryptography. This system deals with implementing 
security using Stegnography. In this end user 
identifies an image which is going to act as the 
carrier of data. The data file is also selected and 
then to achieve greater speed of transmission the
 data file and image file are compressed and sent. 
Prior to this the data is embedded into the image 
and then sent. The image if hacked or interpreted 
by a third party user will open up in any image 
previewed but not displaying the data. This protects
the data from being invisible and hence be secure
 during transmission. The user in the receiving end 
uses another piece of code to retrieve the data from 
the image.


This project is developed using graphics in ‘JAVA’ 
language. The options available are displayed in a 
menu format, like in an online editor. Clicking on 
any particular menu item through mouse or through
 keyboard a dropdown menu is displayed, listing all 
the options available under that menu item and the 
user can select the needed actions according to their
 wish.
